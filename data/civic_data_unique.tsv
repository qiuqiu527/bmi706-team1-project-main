ALK fusions bring the C-terminal ALK kinase domain together with the N terminal region of the fusion partner, and have since been found in a range of cancers including inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, renal cell carcinoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma and colorectal cancer.   In a Phase I trial for crizotinib, a 92% response rate was seen in the subset of patients with a specific EML4-ALK variant, which was higher than the 57% rate in the overall ALK-rearranged population, but the subpopulation numbers were insufficient to correlate variant type with patient response.   Due to restricted wild-type ALK expression, and also mild phenotypes seen in ALK knockout mice, ALK fusions are desirable targets.  ALK inhibitor TAE684 was used in initial characterizations of ALK fusion cancer drivers, and crizotinib – a small molecule ATP-competitor RTK inhibitor which is highly selective for ALK and MET - has been approved as first line therapy in ALK-rearranged NSCLC.     ALK-rearrangement defines an NSCLC subtype that makes up 3-5% of NSCLC cases, and is characterized by higher proportions of younger patients and never smokers. EML4-ALK variant 1 is the most common ALK fusion in NSCLC and was the first to be discovered and demonstrate cancer driver properties in vitro and in mouse models. A Phase I study of crizotinib in ALK-rearranged NSCLC demonstrated an increase in overall survival when compared to standard chemotherapy. These and other initial results prompted accelerated approval for crizotinib in NSCLC.  Continued clinical work demonstrated benefit with crizotinib over chemotherapy in multi-armed studies, and as first line therapy.

In ER+ tumors, mutations in the ESR1 ligand binding domain have been shown to confer resistance to hormone therapy. This evidence has led to an increased use of targeted sequencing of the estrogen receptor in breast and ovarian cancer.

ALK fusions bring the C-terminal ALK kinase domain together with the N terminal region of the fusion partner, and have since been found in a range of cancers including inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, renal cell carcinoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma and colorectal cancer.   In a Phase I trial for crizotinib, a 92% response rate was seen in the subset of patients with a specific EML4-ALK variant, which was higher than the 57% rate in the overall ALK-rearranged population, but the subpopulation numbers were insufficient to correlate variant type with patient response.   Due to restricted wild-type ALK expression, and also mild phenotypes seen in ALK knockout mice, ALK fusions are desirable targets.  ALK inhibitor TAE684 was used in initial characterizations of ALK fusion cancer drivers, and crizotinib – a small molecule ATP-competitor RTK inhibitor which is highly selective for ALK and MET - has been approved as first line therapy in ALK-rearranged NSCLC.     ALK-rearrangement defines an NSCLC subtype that makes up 3-5% of NSCLC cases, and is characterized by higher proportions of younger patients and never smokers. EML4-ALK variant 1 is the most common ALK fusion in NSCLC and was the first to be discovered and demonstrate cancer driver properties in vitro and in mouse models. A Phase I study of crizotinib in ALK-rearranged NSCLC demonstrated an increase in overall survival when compared to standard chemotherapy. These and other initial results prompted accelerated approval for crizotinib in NSCLC.  Continued clinical work demonstrated benefit with crizotinib over chemotherapy in multi-armed studies, and as first line therapy. Crizotinib was also found to remain beneficial to NSCLC patients who had progressed on crizotinib. Additionally, crizotinib was shown to increase intracranial disease control in brain metastasis occurring from ALK-rearranged NSCLC.

A prior phase 2 study demonstrated that treatment with palbociclib (200 mg/d for 14 days every 21 days) resulted in clinical benefit in WD/DDLS but moderate hematologic toxic effects. In this phase 2, nonrandomized, open-label clinical trial conducted at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 60 patients 18 years and older with advanced WD/DDLS and measurable disease by RECIST 1.1 were enrolled from December 2011 to January 2014 and followed to March 2015. Patients received oral palbociclib at new dose scheme, 125 mg/d for 21 days in 28-day cycles. Progression-free survival at 12 weeks was 57.2% and overall median PFS was 17.9 weeks. There was 1 complete response. Toxic effects were primarily hematologic and included neutropenia (grade 3, n = 20 [33%]; grade 4, n = 2 [3%]) but no neutropenic fever.

ALK fusions bring the C-terminal ALK kinase domain together with the N terminal region of the fusion partner, and have since been found in a range of cancers including inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, renal cell carcinoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma and colorectal cancer.   In a Phase I trial for crizotinib, a 92% response rate was seen in the subset of patients with a specific EML4-ALK variant, which was higher than the 57% rate in the overall ALK-rearranged population, but the subpopulation numbers were insufficient to correlate variant type with patient response.   Due to restricted wild-type ALK expression, and also mild phenotypes seen in ALK knockout mice, ALK fusions are desirable targets.  ALK inhibitor TAE684 was used in initial characterizations of ALK fusion cancer drivers, and crizotinib – a small molecule ATP-competitor RTK inhibitor which is highly selective for ALK and MET - has been approved as first line therapy in ALK-rearranged NSCLC.     ALK-rearrangement defines an NSCLC subtype that makes up 3-5% of NSCLC cases, and is characterized by higher proportions of younger patients and never smokers. EML4-ALK variant 1 is the most common ALK fusion in NSCLC and was the first to be discovered and demonstrate cancer driver properties in vitro and in mouse models. A Phase I study of crizotinib in ALK-rearranged NSCLC demonstrated an increase in overall survival when compared to standard chemotherapy. These and other initial results prompted accelerated approval for crizotinib in NSCLC.  Continued clinical work demonstrated benefit with crizotinib over chemotherapy in multi-armed studies, and as first line therapy. Crizotinib was also found to remain beneficial to NSCLC patients who had progressed on crizotinib. Additionally, crizotinib was shown to increase intracranial disease control in brain metastasis occurring from ALK-rearranged NSCLC.

Frameshift truncation mutation found in a single patient with VHL retinal manifestation, which coincides with mutations confirmed to be associated with VHL type 1 in this study. Only moderate evidence of pathogenicity since the protein length changes as a result of in-frame deletions/insertions in a nonrepeat region or stop-loss variants (AMCG code: PM4).	12202531	PubMed		Dollfus et al., 2002, Invest.

The mutations could not be found within 100 healthy controls. One germline truncation mutation was found in a 15-year-old male patient with bilateral renal cell carcinoma and retinal hemangioblastoma with serious retinal detachment. Neither of his parents displayed any mutations in the VHL gene indicating a de novo mutation. ACMG evidence codes: 'PS2' because they observe a de novo mutation (maternity and paternity confirmed), 'PP4' because the patient's phenotypes or family history are highly specific for a disease with single genetic etiology, 'PVS1' because they observe a nonsense variant in a gene where loss of function is a known mechanism of disease.

This partial function in turn leads to an increased risk of tumorgenesis. VHL derived clear cell renal cell carcinoma models however have shown the proteasome inhibitors bortezomib and carfilzomib can act to stabilize mutant VHL-R167Q leading to downregulation of HIF2α and suprressed tumorgenesis.

This partial function in turn leads to an increased risk of tumorgenesis. VHL derived clear cell renal cell carcinoma models however have shown the proteasome inhibitors bortezomib and carfilzomib can act to stabilize mutant VHL-R167Q leading to downregulation of HIF2α and suprressed tumorgenesis.

This partial function in turn leads to an increased risk of tumorgenesis. VHL derived clear cell renal cell carcinoma models however have shown the proteasome inhibitors bortezomib and carfilzomib can act to stabilize mutant VHL-R167Q leading to downregulation of HIF2α and suprressed tumorgenesis.

The E70K missense mutation, located in the Beta-domain of VHL, is rare in open-source genome databases (0.00001489 allele frequency in ExAC, 4.365e-6 allele frequency in gnomAD) and was identified in several individuals with VHL disease symptoms (see evidence statements). Thus, this variant could be assigned ACMG code 'PP2' - Missense mutation in a gene with a low rate of benign missense variation where missense variants are a common mechanism of disease. Although this variant is registered once in ExAC and gnomAD, 'PM2' could be applied (Absent from controls in ESP, 1000 Genomes or ExAC) because VHL manifestations sometimes emerge later in adulthood. Thus, the allele may have been detected in a proband who was not yet affected by symptoms.

ALK fusions bring the C-terminal ALK kinase domain together with the N terminal region of the fusion partner, and have since been found in a range of cancers including inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, renal cell carcinoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma and colorectal cancer.   In a Phase I trial for crizotinib, a 92% response rate was seen in the subset of patients with a specific EML4-ALK variant, which was higher than the 57% rate in the overall ALK-rearranged population, but the subpopulation numbers were insufficient to correlate variant type with patient response.   Due to restricted wild-type ALK expression, and also mild phenotypes seen in ALK knockout mice, ALK fusions are desirable targets.  ALK inhibitor TAE684 was used in initial characterizations of ALK fusion cancer drivers, and crizotinib – a small molecule ATP-competitor RTK inhibitor which is highly selective for ALK and MET - has been approved as first line therapy in ALK-rearranged NSCLC.     ALK-rearrangement defines an NSCLC subtype that makes up 3-5% of NSCLC cases, and is characterized by higher proportions of younger patients and never smokers. EML4-ALK variant 1 is the most common ALK fusion in NSCLC and was the first to be discovered and demonstrate cancer driver properties in vitro and in mouse models. A Phase I study of crizotinib in ALK-rearranged NSCLC demonstrated an increase in overall survival when compared to standard chemotherapy. These and other initial results prompted accelerated approval for crizotinib in NSCLC.  Continued clinical work demonstrated benefit with crizotinib over chemotherapy in multi-armed studies, and as first line therapy.

ABL1 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein. The published breakpoint joins exon 2 or, more frequently, exon 3 of RCSD1 to exon 4 of ABL1 (RCSD1-ABL1 3-4). The fusion is the result of a reciprocal translocation t(1;9)(q24.2;q34.12) and has been identified by FISH/karyotype, RT-PCR, Sanger sequencing, and RNA sequencing. The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, containing the ABL1 SH2, actin binding domain, and tyrosine kinase domain, which is thought to upregulate the mitogen-activate protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways. Specifically, the inclusion of the tyrosine kinase domain may affect functionality and offer a target for therapeutic inhibition.

This lack of efficacy can likely be to blame for the poorer prognosis for patients with this mutation as compared to patients with wildtype EGFR or other types of EGFR mutations. Approximately half of EGFR mutant tumors with acquired resistance to TKI inhibition have been shown to harbor this mutation, implicating it as a mechanism of acquired therapy resistence. A third generation TKI (osimertinib) has been approved for the treatment of EGFR T790M mutant NSCLC.

Trastuzumab first found considerable success, and was approved for treatment, in HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) which had progressed under chemotherapy. These metastatic cancers nonetheless progressed under trastuzumab, and other forms of therapy were studied for next line treatments, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Lapatinib, a reversible inhibitor of tyrosine kinase activity in ErbB1 and ErbB2, and afatinib, an irreversible inhibitor of all 4 ErbB forms were shown to have activity in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC. Interestingly trastuzumab itself also turned out to remain effective in treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC. The LUX-Breast 1 trial compared a TKI-based treatment (afatinib) to a trastuzumab-based treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC, and the LUX-Breast 3 trial addressed TKI application in the context of HER2 MBC with difficult to treat brain metastases. In neither of these cases was the TKI more effective, making successful future replacement of trastuzumab-based therapy with a TKI in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC seem unlikely. Instead, a potential role for TKIs in this disease context is revealed in preclinical work suggesting synergism between TKI and trastuzumab action, and clinical trials with lapatinib or afatinib combined with trastuzumab indicate that dual HER2 blockade may be an effective therapy. Dual antibody HER2 blockade with pertuzumab instead of TKI in HER2 MBC has also recently shown strong results in the CLEOPATRA trial.

The COL1A1-PDGFB fusion was detected in 42 (74%) out of the 57 sample after performing targeted PCR amplification and direct sequencing. The 42 samples were then evaluated for PDGFB and PDGFRB gene amplification using qPCR. SYBR green assay was also used to evaluate PDGFB gene amplification in comparison with a reference gene and a normal tissue. PDGFB mRNA expression was detected in all analyzed samples and was significantly higher in tumor cells compared to adjacent normal tissue; as amplification levels (copy number of PDGFB/ copy number of reference gene) varied from 0.6. to 8.3 (mean 2.4) in 42 tumor samples, and from 0.4 to 3.0 (mean 1.2) in 20 adjacent normal tissue samples (P = 0.0002). Moreover, the mRNA expression levels of PDGFB and PDGFRB showed a significant correlation (P < 0.0001).

Gene expression profiling showed P21 gene was expressed at a higher level (1.7 folds) in mutant receptor cells, providing evidence of ERK1/2 and STAT1/3 activation. The mutant receptor produced a highly sustained ERK1/2 activation even after 1 hour of PDGF treatment, whereas wild-type expressing cells showed a decrease in ERK1/2 activity. Lastly, cells only expressing the variant K650E receptor were able to phosphorylate tyrosine in STAT1, and tyrosine, along with serine, in a ligand-independent manner in STAT3. Authors confirm that mutant FGFR3 activates ERK1/2 and STAT1/3 in a ligand-independent manner and maintains this activation over longer periods of time when treated with ligand than does the wild-type receptor.","Nowroozi et al., 2005, Hum Mol Genet",3.0,accepted,10493.0,1400.0,23.0,4,1807889.0,1807889.0,A,G,ENST00000340107.4,,,,,75.0,GRCh37,This is a pilot variant of the FGFR ClinGen Somatic Cancer Variant Curation Expert Panel (SC-VCEP) used to establish FGFR specific modifications to the ClinGen/CGC/VICC procedure for classification of somatic variant oncogenicity.,,https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/10493,https://civicdb.org/links/variants/1400,https://civicdb.org/links/genes/23,2023

The authors also looked at FGFR3 phosphorylation using western blot analysis and found that FGF2-bound dimers had increased FGFR3 phosphorylation. Therefore it was concluded that the FGF1 bound dimer is the inactive state, while the FGF2 bound dimer is the active state. Common bladder cancer and Crouzon syndrome with acanthosis nigricans variant FGFR3 A391E dimerization and phosphorylation were measured via FRET and western blot assays respectively. The A391E substitution was shown to activate FGFR3 through ligand-independent dimerization similar to the FGF2 bound state. Thus the authors concluded that the A391E mutation traps FGF3R in its most active state.","Sarabipour et al., 2016, Nat Commun",4.0,accepted,10513.0,4023.0,23.0,4,1806153.0,1806153.0,C,A,ENST00000440486.8,,,,,,GRCh37,This is a pilot variant of the FGFR ClinGen Somatic Cancer Variant Curation Expert Panel (SC-VCEP) used to establish FGFR specific modifications to the ClinGen/CGC/VICC procedure for classification of somatic variant oncogenicity.,Somatic,https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/10513,https://civicdb.org/links/variants/4023,https://civicdb.org/links/genes/23,2023
